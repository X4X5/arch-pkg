# arch-pkg
A little thing I'm working on for my Arch system. Written in bash.

The whole point of this script is to wrap pacman, flatpak, and yay (AUR helper) in an executable script. More just to see what I can do. This script is meant for Arch Linux, but can be used on deravitives, as well

## Installation
I guess this is complete enough to use. To install, just download the arch-wrap file, and move it to `/usr/local/bin` to use it system wide in the terminal.

## Usage
```Usage: arch-pkg [install|remove|update] [package manager] [package name]```
